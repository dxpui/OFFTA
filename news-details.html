                                million. There are <strong>2.09 </strong>million WLR lines and the number of telephone

                            <p>The following is an update on the principal areas of project activity being led by OTA2.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Passive Infrastructure Access</h2>
                            <p>Operational performance remains good.</p>
                            <p>Whereabouts compliance: Openreach have shared their revised measurement proposals with
                                industry. There will be a period of soft launch where the CP performance can be assessed
                                with them and any anomalies in the process can be ironed out.</p>
                            <p>Incident &amp; Planned Works Management: This is now in an ongoing state for deployment
                                and review, further analysis will be undertaken after any serious incidents.</p>
                            <p>Workshop was held to review the emerging challenges of Pole top congestion and technical
                                solutions around equipment rearrangement and good engineering practice. This format will
                                be repeated to address other areas of technical challenge:</p>
                            <p>Areas of interest</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Health &amp; Safety and good working practices</li>

                            <h2>Ethernet</h2>
                            <p>Performance remains steady.</p>
                            <p>The order profile remains very much the same as we have reported in recent months EAD has
                                continued to grow whilst the other order types have dropped back, overall the order
                                profile is c1500 per week.</p>
                            <p>Completion rate of c1100 orders per week has continued through April. The workstack
                                continues to remain stable at around 20k.</p>
                            <h3>Areas of interest</h3>
                            <p>EAD2: Openreach have shared the development timeline with CPs and discussions have
                                continued to shape the product.</p>
                            <p>Exchange Exit: Openreach have begun their detailed engagement with the Ethernet and
                                Optical CPs looking at the impact of exiting key exchanges and looking at building a
                                plan assess the technical challenges associated with the programme. This will enable a
                                greater understanding of impacts and resource demands.</p>
                            <h2>Copper and Fibre</h2>
                            <p>Industry engagement to review FTTP metrics is continuing and will run through to late
                                summer. The expectation is that the metric set will include some of the existing
                                measures and also metrics currently shared by the service managers with CPs. The aim is
                                to define a set of Key Performance Indicators which are appropriately supported,
                                relevant and recognised by Openreach and Industry and which will effectively track the
                                end customer experience.</p>
                            <p>Good progress has been made regarding reviewing the KCI2 Assure process and a trial of a
                                new ‘hybrid’, which it is hoped will improve the number of single visit completions, is
                                showing good initial results but has been extended to gather additional data.</p>
                            <p>Discussions have commenced on an SLG for FTTP cancellations following Openreach delay.
                                This is being run under the 6-month WFTMR process, which puts an end date of mid-July on
                                the negotiations, however these are currently progressing slowly.</p>
                            <h2>All-IP Steering Group</h2>
                            <p>Ofcom wrote to some CPs at the end of 2023 regarding their responsibilities towards
                                vulnerable customers with telecare alarms and made the statement that no telecare device
                                must be left in a non-working state post migration. In view of this CPs have stopped
                                provision orders where a telecare alarm is present and Openreach is returning any that
                                slip through the order process. CPs and Openreach developed a set of exemptions
                                regarding which provision orders can proceed. A potential approach has now been
                                identified which will allow CPs to progress these without significant systems
                                development.</p>
                            <p>The Prove Telecare development which was rescoped to allow for a full reversion of the
                                line, remains on track for release and trial later this year.</p>
                            <p>Openreach has now published its Phase 2 response to the Exchange Exit consultation and
                                briefed industry on its approach to progressing discussions.</p>
                            <h2>Customer Switching</h2>
                            <p>The previously announced a ‘go-live’ date of 12 September 2024 for OTS remains the target
                                for all CPs with residential end customers. A number of CPs are already testing their
                                solutions through the TOTSCo Hub and successfully passing messages between each other as
                                part of the OTS Process, as part of the planned, ‘ramp-up’ of testing and ‘live’ trials
                                ahead of the 12 September date - more information can be found at the <a
                                    href="https://totsco.org.uk">TOTSCo website</a>. OTA2 will remain heavily involved
                                with TOTSCo, CPs and Ofcom in helping industry meet the ‘go-live’ date.,</p>
                            <p>The GPLB-SG (Gaining Provider Led Business – Steering Group) maintains its focus on
                                providing business customers and their CPs with a robust switching solution, that will
                                work alongside OTS and deliver improvements over the pre-existing ‘NoT+’ and Number
                                Porting processes.</p>
                            <p>The GPLB-SG have also recorded the first in a series of informative ‘webinar’ type
                                events, which will provide an introduction to the Business Switching Process, its
                                principles and operation. This webinar is in post-production editing and is planned to
                                be released before the end of this month.</p>
                            <h2>Number Porting</h2>
                            <p>The remaining work around OTS Porting continues being centred on recognising the
                                potential impacts of ‘manual porting’ activities (as opposed to the fully automated
                                solutions that dominated the original ‘Express Porting’ proposals) and how these should
                                be reflected in setting and agreeing the SLAs.</p>
                            <p>The wider Porting groups continue to work through both the ‘day-to-day’ operational
                                challenges of our industry.</p>
